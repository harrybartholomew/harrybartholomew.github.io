Reference management software, such as Zotero and Mendeley, use the *Citation Style Language* (CSL) XML format to
transform
bibliographic metadata into properly-formatted citations and bibliographical references according to a particular style.

While there are over 10,000 styles in the [Zotero style repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles), authors may still
find they need either to reference in a style not already included or to make minor changes to a pre-existing style to
suit their specific needs.

This repository will contain CSL files I've written for students and staff at my institution.
