While I worked at Queens' College Library, I began a project to convert the source files for the Bliss Bibliographic Classification to RDF format using the SKOS data model.
This Github repository contains the Python script I wrote to parse the Bliss source code and rewrite it as a SKOS Turtle file.

I wrote an [article](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/18073) for the *Code4Lib Journal* detailing the purpose, methods and benefits of this project.
