I gave a lightning talk on the use of automation in collection development at the 2023 OxCam Conference (for college
library at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge). I spoke about the Python script I wrote to
find matches between reading list data and catalogue data, as well as using the Open Library API and its work
identifiers to retrieve the bibliographic data for related editions. More about this project can be
found [here](https://harrybartholomew.github.io/work/3.html).
