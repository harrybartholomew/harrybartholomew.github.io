> On Sunday 7 June 2020, the bronze statue of a governing member of the Royal African Society was toppled and rolled
> into Bristol Harbour by Black Lives Matter protesters. Two days later, the University of Liverpool announced its plans
> to remove the name ‘Gladstone’ from one of its halls of residence, due to its association with slave ownership. The
> BLM movement has triggered a resurgence of concern and interest in Britain about our colonial heritage, and the legacy
> left by enslavement. At this time, the research at Queens’ into the college’s own links to slavery is especially needed.
