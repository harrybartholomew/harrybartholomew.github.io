> Doughnut-economist, Kate Raworth, famously shows in her delicious model the sustainable zone in which the global
> economy meets humanity’s needs without exceeding the finite planetary ceiling. Applying this template to Queens’
> library collections, the sweet spot for book provision surpasses the threshold of our users’ information requirements
> while contained within the physical limits of our shelves. In a small and cosy library like ours, the dough is miserly
> thin with a overly large hole: the absolute minimum number of books needed for a comprehensive modern academic library
> collection is stiflingly close to our shelving capacity. This leaves us in a claustrophobically tight spot: new
> acquisitions often must be shoehorned into the sparse gaps on the shelves, and mustering enough space for the steady
> inflow of fresh material can make daily shelving an onerous slog. Left too long, and our students will find themselves
> wading through densely packed, outdated, degraded books in their search for quality information sources. A project for
> sustainable storage to avoid critical overspill began last summer, as librarians worked to relocate a significant
> portion of the collection to closed-access stores; at the same time, we took the first steps on an even longer journey
> to better prepare our collection for a linked-data future.
