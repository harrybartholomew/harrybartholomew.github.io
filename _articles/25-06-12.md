I assisted Dr Christopher Sabatini (Senior Research Fellow for Latin America, Chatham House) in his research on
international sanctions through data analysis work: extracting information using computational methods from datasets on
international sanctions.

This research has produced an expert comment and a research paper, in both of which I was acknowledged.

In the expert
comment, ‘[History suggests Trump’s snapped back sanctions won't deliver change in Venezuela](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/06/history-suggests-trumps-snapped-back-sanctions-wont-deliver-change-venezuela)’[^1]:
> Data analysis, with assistance from Harry Bartholomew, draws from Syropoulos, C. et al. (2023), ‘The global sanctions
> data base – Release 3, Review of International Economics; Felbermayr, G. et al. (2020), ‘The global sanctions data
> base’, European Economic Review; and Kirikakha, A. et al. (2021), ‘The Global Sanctions Data Base (GSDB): an update
> that includes the years of the Trump presidency’.

In the research paper,
_[Understanding and Improving Sanctions Today: Why and How Many Sanctions Fail, and What to Do about It](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/07/understanding-and-improving-sanctions-today/acknowledgments)_[^2]:
> Harry Bartholomew conducted the data analysis on the unwieldy Excel database that we created. Thank you for making
> sense of it, Harry.
