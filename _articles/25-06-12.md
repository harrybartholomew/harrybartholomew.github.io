I assisted Dr Christopher Sabatini (Senior Research Fellow for Latin America, Chatham House) on his Expert Comment through data analysis work: extracting information using computational methods from datasets on international sanctions. This contribution is acknowledged in the Comment:


>Data analysis, with assistance from Harry Bartholomew, draws from Syropoulos, C. et al. (2023), ‘The global sanctions data base – Release 3, Review of International Economics; Felbermayr, G. et al. (2020), ‘The global sanctions data base’, European Economic Review; and Kirikakha, A. et al. (2021), ‘The Global Sanctions Data Base (GSDB): an update that includes the years of the Trump presidency’.
