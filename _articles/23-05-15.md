> When librarians enthuse about classification systems to those uninitiated in the profession, there is not a small
> chance they will be met with words to the effect of “who cares?” Yet, as American journalist Susan Orlean reminisces, a
> reader with classmark in hand scanning library shelves for the matching letters and numbers from the catalogue they
> recently jotted down (or more likely today, screenshotted) will often happily encounter related neighbouring books they
> might have never heard of and did not know they wanted. This possibility for serendipitous discovery comes from a
> process of classification: defining a book’s subject and representing it with a brief, alphanumeric code. The outcome: a
> singular, linear sequence guiding readers through the universe of knowledge. Our recent survey of Queens’ students found
> that around a quarter of undergraduates browse library shelves to find books to read for their studies, and so,
> consciously or otherwise, interact with classification systems.
