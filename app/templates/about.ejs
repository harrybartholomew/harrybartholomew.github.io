    <p>I am the Librarian at The Athenaeum Club, stewarding a historic yet developing special collection.</p>
    <p>I have worked in various types of libraries—antiquarian, academic, think tank—bringing technical skills in discovery systems, metadata management, and digital access to traditional library work so that that historic collections are efficiently preserved and continually discovered.</p>
    <p>My professional interests include:
    <ul>
        <li>early printed books and antiquarian collections;
        <li>knowledge organisation, classification, and indexing;</li>
        <li>metadata standards, linked data, and BIBFRAME;</li>
        <li>library systems, data migration, and catalogue development;</li>
        <li>automation of library workflows;</li>
        <li>research/academic library data services, such as research data management, version control and data visualisation support.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>I have a MA from the University of Cambridge in Modern and Medieval Languages (French and German, with a bit of Polish and Ukrainian) and an MSc in Information Science from Northumbria University.
