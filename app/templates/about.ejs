    <p>As the Reader Services Librarian at Queens' College, Cambridge, I provide high-quality and user-focused library services to the academic community. I develop and maintain the college's modern (post-1800) library collections and deliver information and research skills support.</p>

<p>My professional interests include:<ul>
<li>digital humanities (using Python as my primary programming language);</li>
<li>knowledge organisation, specifically classification and indexing;</li>
<li>academic library data services, such as research data management, version control and data visualisation support.</li>
</ul>
 My current professional project is developing RDF-encoded classifications and taxonomies for use in academic and special collections.</p>

<p>I have a MA from Cambridge in Modern and Medieval Languages (French and German, with a bit of Polish and Ukrainian) and an MSc in Information Science from Northumbria University. I also have experience working with special collections—cataloguing around 1,100 early printed books during my traineeship—and archives.</p>
